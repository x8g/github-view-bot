# Github View Bot
## Usage
The URL needed for the view bot to work is the type in my **README.md** file on my github page just make sure you have the exact same one setup like mine!
## Creds
Credits aren't really needed since github view bot's are pretty simple so eh but x8g/zt
## Support
**zt#7380** or [.gg/glad](https://discord.gg/glad)

# YT View Bot
## Usage
common sense but this was only a test so im 90% none of the requests sent will count as "views"
